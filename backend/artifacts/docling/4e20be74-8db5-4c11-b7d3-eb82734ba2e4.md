This Annual Report on Form 10-K ('Form 10-K') contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Many of the forward-looking statements are located in Part I, Item 1  of  this  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  'Business'  and  Part  II,  Item  7  of  this  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region.

## Markets and Distribution

The  Company's  customers  are  primarily  in  the  consumer,  small  and  mid-sized  business,  education,  enterprise  and  government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024, the Company's net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.

## Competition

The markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property.

The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products,  services  and  technologies  to  the  marketplace.  The  Company  designs  and  develops  nearly  the  entire  solution  for  its products,  including  the  hardware,  operating  system,  numerous  software  applications  and  related  services.  Principal  competitive factors  important  to  the  Company  include  price,  product  and  service  features  (including  security  features),  relative  price  and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.

The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories,  and  services.  The  Company  faces  substantial  competition  in  these  markets  from  companies  that  have  significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company's services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company's  product  features  and  applications  within  their  products,  or  collaborate  to  offer  integrated  solutions  that  are  more competitive than those they currently offer.

## Supply of Components

Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.

The  Company  has  entered  into  agreements  for  the  supply  of  many  components;  however,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

## Research and Development

Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development ('R&D'), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.

## Intellectual Property

The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.

The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has  accumulated  a  large  portfolio  of  issued  and  registered  intellectual  property  rights  around  the  world.  No  single  intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company's products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.

In  addition  to  Company-owned  intellectual  property,  many  of  the  Company's  products  and  services  are  designed  to  include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the  Company's  products,  processes  and  services.  While  the  Company  has  generally  been  able  to  obtain  such  licenses  on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.

## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.

## Human Capital

The Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.

## Compensation and Benefits

The  Company  believes  that  compensation  should  be  competitive  and  equitable,  and  should  enable  employees  to  share  in  the Company's success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.

## Growth and Development

The Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University  on  leadership,  management  and  influence,  as  well  as Apple  culture  and  values. Team  members  can  also  take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their well-being.

## Workplace Practices and Policies

The  Company  is  an  equal  opportunity  employer  committed  to  inclusion  and  diversity  and  to  providing  a  workplace  free  of harassment or discrimination.

## Inclusion and Diversity

The Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.

## Engagement

The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.

## Health and Safety

The Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis  management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.

## Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The  Company's  business,  reputation,  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  stock  price  can  be  affected  by  a  number  of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition, past financial  performance  should  not  be  considered  to  be  a  reliable  indicator  of  future  performance,  and  investors  should  not  use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.

This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Form 10-K.

## Macroeconomic and Industry Risks

The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic  conditions  can  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial condition.

The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales. In addition,  the  Company's  global  supply  chain  is  large  and  complex  and  a  majority  of  the  Company's  supplier  facilities,  including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company's products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.

In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company's products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors,  cellular  network  carriers  and  other  channel  partners,  and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.

Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company's trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company's ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company's financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.

Political  events,  trade  and  other  international  disputes,  geopolitical  tensions,  conflict,  terrorism,  natural  disasters,  public  health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.

The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business  and  supply  chain.  The  impact  can  be  particularly  significant  if  these restrictive  measures  apply  to  countries  and  regions  where  the  Company  derives  a  significant  portion  of  its  revenues  and/or  has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company's business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company's business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business.

Many of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers,  are  in  locations  that  are  prone  to  earthquakes  and  other  natural  disasters.  Global  climate  change  is  resulting  in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  and  extreme  weather  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  In  addition,  the Company's and its suppliers' operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor  disputes,  public  health  issues  and  other  events  beyond  the  Company's  control.  For  example,  global  supply  chains  can  be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.

Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings, increase the Company's costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.

The Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation. Major public  health  issues,  including  pandemics  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  have  adversely  affected,  and  could  in  the  future materially  adversely  affect,  the  Company  due  to  their  impact  on  the  global  economy  and  demand  for  consumer  products;  the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.

Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume  operations,  and  lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and manufacture  of  many  critical  components,  a  business  interruption  affecting  such  sources  would  exacerbate  any  negative consequences  to  the  Company.  While  the  Company  maintains  insurance  coverage  for  certain  types  of  losses,  such  insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.

Global markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.

The  Company's  products  and  services  are  offered  in  highly  competitive  global  markets  characterized  by  aggressive  price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.

The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products,  services  and  technologies  to  the  marketplace.  The  Company  designs  and  develops  nearly  the  entire  solution  for  its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.

The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective  intellectual  property  protection  is  not  consistently  available  in  every  country  in  which  the  Company  operates.  If  the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company's intellectual property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.

The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense  as  competitors  have  aggressively  cut  prices  and  lowered  product  margins.  Certain  competitors  have  the  resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.

Additionally,  the  Company  faces  significant  competition  as  competitors  imitate  the  Company's  product  features  and  applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company's approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.

The Company's services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and  have  established  service  offerings  with  large  customer  bases.  The  Company  competes  with  business  models  that  provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.

The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company's ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.

## Business Risks

To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.

Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually  introduce  new  products,  services  and  technologies,  enhance  existing  products  and  services,  effectively  stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful  development,  market  acceptance,  the  Company's  ability  to  manage  the  risks  associated  with  new  technologies  and production  ramp-up  issues,  the  availability  of  application  software  or  other  third-party  support  for  the  Company's  products  and services,  the  effective  management  of  purchase  commitments  and  inventory  levels  in  line  with  anticipated  product  demand,  the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.

## The  Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.

Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland,  India,  Japan,  South  Korea,  Taiwan  and  Vietnam,  and  a  significant  concentration  of  this  manufacturing  is  currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often  in  single  locations. The  Company  has  also  outsourced  much  of  its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect  on  the  quality  or  quantity  of  products  manufactured  or  services  provided,  or  adversely  affect  the  Company's  flexibility  to respond  to  changing  conditions. Although  arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for  product  defect  expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of  product  defects  and  experiences  unanticipated  product  defect  liabilities  from  time  to  time.  While  the  Company  relies  on  its partners  to  adhere  to  its  supplier  code  of  conduct,  violations  of  the  supplier  code  of  conduct  occur  from  time  to  time  and  can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The  Company  relies  on  single-source  outsourcing  partners  in  the  U.S.,  Asia  and  Europe  to  supply  and  manufacture  many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of  reasons,  including  natural  and  man-made  disasters,  information  technology  system  failures,  commercial  disputes,  economic, business,  labor,  environmental,  public  health  or  political  issues,  trade  and  other  international  disputes,  geopolitical  tensions,  or conflict.

The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure  the  supply  of  components  and  finished  goods,  if  these  outsourcing  partners  or  suppliers  experience  severe  financial problems or other disruptions in their  business,  such  continued  supply  can  be  disrupted  or  terminated,  and  the  recoverability  of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.

Changes or additions  to  the  Company's  supply  chain  require  considerable  time  and  resources  and  involve  significant  risks  and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.

## Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.

Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially  reasonable  terms,  or  at  all.  Such  disruptions  could  occur  in  the  future.  While  the  Company  has  entered  into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  the  suppliers'  yields  have  matured  or  their  manufacturing  capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or  constrained,  or  when  an  outsourcing  partner  has  delayed  shipments  of  completed  products  to  the  Company,  the  Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected  depending  on  the  time  required  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  from  the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.

## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.

The  Company  offers  complex  hardware  and  software  products  and  services  that  can  be  affected  by  design  and  manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products  the  Company  purchases  from  third  parties.  Component  defects  could  make  the  Company's  products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company's services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other  negative  content  and  experiences. There  can  be  no  assurance  the  Company  will  be  able  to  detect  and  fix  all  issues  and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety  and  security  of  a  user's  device.  In  addition,  the  Company  can  be  exposed  to  product  liability  claims,  recalls,  product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.

## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.

The  Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value. Although  the  Company  believes  its  inventory,  capital  assets,  inventory  prepayments  and  other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.

The  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments. Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  cover  the  Company's  forecasted  component  and  manufacturing  requirements,  typically  for periods  up  to  150  days.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are  volatile,  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid  technology  and  price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.

## The  Company  relies  on  access  to  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  may  not  be  available  to  the  Company  on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

The Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in  the  future  may  compete,  current  extensive  patent  coverage  and  the  rapid  rate  of  issuance  of  new  patents,  the  Company's products  and  services  can  unknowingly  infringe  existing  patents  or  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  From  time  to  time,  the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude the Company from  selling  certain  products  or  services,  or  otherwise  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  business,  results  of operations and financial condition.

## The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.

The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.

The  Company  believes  the  availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services  for  its  products  depends  in  part  on  the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.

The Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading  software  for  competitors'  products  with  larger  market  share.  When  developers  focus  their  efforts  on  these  competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.

The  Company  relies  on  the  continued  availability  and  development  of  compelling  and  innovative  software  applications  for  its products.  The  Company's  products  and  operating  systems  are  subject  to  rapid  technological  change,  and  when  third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes  to  deliver  improved  customer  experiences,  can  operate  incorrectly,  and  can  result  in  dissatisfied  customers  and  lower customer demand for the Company's products.

The  Company  distributes  third-party  applications  for  its  products  through  the  App  Store.  For  the  vast  majority  of  applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store  and  Safari   in  the  European  Union  ('EU')  as  it  seeks  to  comply  with  the  Digital  Markets Act  (the  'DMA'),  including  new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps,  alternative  payment  processing  for  apps  across  the  Company's  operating  systems,  and  additional  tools  and  application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the  Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced App Store  or  other  sales,  reductions  in  the  rate  of  the  commission  that  the  Company  retains  on  such  sales,  or  if  the  rate  of  the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. ®

Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions  to,  third-party  content,  as  well  as  the  right  to  incorporate  specific  content  into  the  Company's  own  services.  The licensing  or  other  distribution  arrangements  for  this  content  can  be  for  relatively  short  time  periods  and  do  not  guarantee  the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors  currently  or  in  the  future  may  offer  competing  products  and  services,  and  can  take  actions  to  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.

The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.

Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.

The  Company's  success  depends  largely  on  the  talents  and  efforts  of  its  team  members,  the  continued  service  and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company's ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.

Much of the Company's future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service  of  key  personnel,  including  its  Chief  Executive  Officer,  executive  team  and  other  highly  skilled  employees.  Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where  most  of  the  Company's  key  personnel  are  located.  In  addition  to  intense  competition  for  talent,  workforce  dynamics  are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company's culture, reputation and operational flexibility.

The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

## The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.

The  Company  distributes  its  products  and  certain  of  its  services  through  cellular  network  carriers,  wholesalers,  retailers  and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells  third-party  products  in  most  of  its  major  markets  directly  to  consumers,  small  and  mid-sized  businesses,  and  education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.

Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company's products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users' purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.

The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores  with  Company  employees  and  contractors,  and  improving  product  placement  displays.  These  programs  can  require  a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company's products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company's products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.

## The Company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.

The  Company  and  its  global  supply  chain  are  dependent  on  complex  information  technology  systems  and  are  exposed  to information  technology  system  failures  or  network  disruptions  caused  by  natural  disasters,  accidents,  power  disruptions, telecommunications  failures,  acts  of  terrorism  or  war,  computer  viruses,  physical  or  electronic  break-ins,  ransomware  or  other cybersecurity  incidents,  or  other  events  or  disruptions.  System  upgrades,  redundancy  and  other  continuity  measures  may  be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company's or its vendors' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company's business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company's products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

## Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.

The Company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with respect to the Company's customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the  Company  takes  steps  to  secure  confidential  information  that  is  provided  to  or  accessible  by  third  parties  working  on  the Company's  behalf,  such  measures  are  not  always  effective  and  losses  or  unauthorized  access  to,  or  releases  of,  confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact  the  Company's  stock  price,  materially  damage  commercial  relationships,  and  expose  the  Company  to  litigation  or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent  controls,  avoid  detection,  and  remove  or  obfuscate  forensic  evidence,  all  of  which  hinders  the  Company's  ability  to identify,  investigate  and  recover  from  incidents.  In  addition,  attacks  against  the  Company  and  its  customers  can  escalate  during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.

Although  malicious  attacks  perpetrated  to  gain  access  to  confidential  information,  including  personal  information,  affect  many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.

The  Company  has  implemented  systems  and  processes  intended  to  secure  its  information  technology  systems  and  prevent unauthorized  access  to  or  loss  of  sensitive  data,  and  mitigate  the  impact  of  unauthorized  access,  including  through  the  use  of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other  irregularities.  For  example,  third  parties  can  fraudulently  induce  the  Company's  or  its  suppliers'  and  other  third  parties' employees  or  customers  into  disclosing  usernames,  passwords  or  other  sensitive  information,  which  can,  in  turn,  be  used  for unauthorized access to the Company's or such suppliers' or third parties' systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company's products and services.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.

Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company's ongoing business, present risks not originally  contemplated  and  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  reputation,  results  of  operations  and financial condition.

The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate  return  on  capital,  potential  impairment  of  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  and  significant  write-offs.  Investment  and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company's ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

## The Company's retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.

The  Company's  retail  operations  are  subject  to  many  factors  that  pose  risks  and  uncertainties  and  could  adversely  impact  the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company's ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks

## The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.

The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim  against  an  indemnified  third  party.  The  number  of  claims,  legal  proceedings  and  government  investigations  involving  the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.

The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts  in  several  U.S.  jurisdictions,  as  well  as  internationally  in  various  countries.  The  plaintiffs  in  these  actions  frequently  seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.

Regardless  of  the  merit  of  particular  claims,  defending  against  litigation  or  responding  to  government  investigations  can  be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter  into  agreements  or  other  arrangements  to  settle  litigation  and  resolve  such  challenges.  There  can  be  no  assurance  such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the  Company's  cost  of  sales  and  operating  expenses  and  require  the  Company  to  change  its  business  practices  and  limit  the Company's ability to offer certain products and services.

The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.

## The  Company  is  subject  to  complex  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  which  exposes  the  Company  to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company's business.

The Company's global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data  security  and  data  localization;  consumer  protection;  advertising,  sales,  billing  and  e-commerce;  financial  services  and technology;  product  liability;  intellectual  property  ownership  and  infringement;  digital  platforms;  machine  learning  and  artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of thirdparty software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions;  anti-money  laundering;  foreign  ownership  and  investment;  tax;  and  environmental,  health  and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company's business by increasing the Company's costs, limiting the Company's ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers,  imposing  changes  to  the  design  of  the  Company's  products  and  services,  impacting  customer  demand  for  the Company's products and services, and requiring changes to the Company's business or supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company's products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must  navigate  new  legal,  regulatory  and  ethical  considerations  relating  to  such  technologies.  The  Company  has  implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company's employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company's policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company's business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company's products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

## Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company's business.

Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental,  social  and  governance  considerations  and  implementation  of  the  Company's  announced  goals  and  initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company's control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and  initiatives.  In  addition,  some  stakeholders  may  disagree  with  the  Company's  goals  and  initiatives. Any  failure,  or  perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards  could  result  in  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  against  the  Company  and  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.

From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.

The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and APIs  for  developers.  The  Company  has  also  continued  to  make  changes  to  its  compliance  plan  in  response  to  feedback  and engagement with the European Commission (the 'Commission'). Although the Company's compliance plan is intended to address the  DMA's  obligations,  it  has  been  challenged  by  the  Commission  and  may  be  challenged  further  by  private  litigants. The  DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.

The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact  on  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  For  example,  the  Company  is  subject  to  civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for 'performance smartphones' and 'smartphones' generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to  investigations  and  litigation  that,  if  resolved  against  those  other  companies,  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and  financial  condition.  For  example,  the  Company  earns  revenue  from  licensing  arrangements  with  Google  LLC  and  other companies  to  offer  their  search  services  on  the  Company's  platforms  and  applications,  and  certain  of  these  arrangements  are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.

There can be no assurance the Company's business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of  the  Company's  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the  Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.

## The  Company's  business  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  and  international  laws,  rules,  policies  and  other  obligations regarding data protection.

The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.

The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.

In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is  also  subject  to  specific  obligations  relating  to  information  considered  sensitive  under  applicable  laws,  such  as  health  data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations.  If  the  Company  fails  to  adequately  comply  with  these  rules  and  requirements,  or  if  health  data  or  financial  data  is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.

Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

## Financial Risks

## The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.

The Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures  and  product  pricing  actions  that  the  Company  may  take  in  response  to  such  pressures;  increased  competition;  the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its  product  and  service  offerings;  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates;  inflation  and  other  macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand  for  that  product  could  significantly  impact  quarterly  net  sales.  The  Company  could  also  be  subject  to  unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company's logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.

## The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.

The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales  and  operating  expenses  worldwide.  Gross  margins  on  the  Company's  products  in  foreign  countries  and  on  products  that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated  sales  and  earnings,  and  generally  leads  the  Company  to  raise  international  pricing,  potentially  reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.

Conversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.

The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.

## The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.

The Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

## The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.

The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and  resellers.  The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  services  directly  to  small  and  mid-sized  businesses  and  education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables  can  be  concentrated  within  cellular  network  carriers  or  other  resellers.  The  Company's  exposure  to  credit  and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and  other  vendors  that  manufacture  subassemblies  or  assemble  final  products  for  the  Company.  In  addition,  the  Company  has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2024, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.

## The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.

The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in  tax  laws  or  their  interpretation.  The  application  of  tax  laws  may  be  uncertain,  require  significant  judgment  and  be  subject  to differing interpretations.

The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

## General Risks

## The price of the Company's stock is subject to volatility.

The Company's stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume  fluctuations  that  have  affected  stock  prices  in  ways  that  may  have  been  unrelated  to  these  companies'  operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company's Board of Directors (the 'Board'), and the Company's share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company's stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.

## Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

## Item 1C.    Cybersecurity

The Company's management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying, assessing and  managing  any  material  risks  from  cybersecurity  threats.  The  Company's  Head  of  Corporate  Information  Security  leads  a dedicated  Information  Security  team  of  highly  skilled  individuals  with  experience  across  industries  that,  among  other  things, develops  and  distributes  information  security  policies,  standards  and  procedures;  engages  in  employee  cybersecurity  training; implements  security  controls;  assesses  security  risk  and  compliance  posture;  monitors  and  responds  to  security  events;  and executes security testing and assessments. The Company's Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive knowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership positions at other large technology companies and leading the Company's Information Security team since 2016.

The Company's Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage security incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security processes and incident  response. A  dedicated  Supplier  Trust  team  manages  information  security  risks  the  Company  is  exposed  to  through  its supplier  relationships.  The  Company  has  processes  to  log,  track,  address,  and  escalate  for  further  assessment  and  report,  as appropriate,  cybersecurity  incidents  across  the  Company  and  its  suppliers  to  senior  management  and  the  Audit  and  Finance Committee  (the  'Audit  Committee')  of  the  Board.  The  Company's  enterprise  risk  management  program  is  designed  to  identify, assess, and monitor the Company's business risks, including financial, operational, compliance and reputational risks, and reflects management's assessment of cybersecurity risks.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee regularly reviews  and  discusses  the  Company's  cybersecurity  risks  with  management,  including  the  Company's  Head  of  Corporate Information Security, its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assurance, and Internal Audit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly reports the substance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as necessary, and recommends to the Board such actions as the Audit Committee deems appropriate.

For a discussion of the Company's cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading 'Risk Factors.'

## Item 2.    Properties

The Company's headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.

## Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

## Digital Markets Act Investigations

On March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under  the  DMA.  The  Commission's  investigations  concern  (1)  Article  5(4)  of  the  DMA,  which  relates  to  how  developers  may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser  choice  screen  on  iOS.  On  June  24,  2024,  the  Commission  announced  its  preliminary  findings  in  the  Article  5(4) investigation alleging that the Company's App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company's new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue  a  cease  and  desist  order  and  may  impose  fines  up  to  10%  of  the  Company's  annual  worldwide  net  sales. Although  any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission's order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.

## Department of Justice Lawsuit

On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'DOJ') and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in  the  markets  for  'performance  smartphones'  and  'smartphones'  in  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws. The  DOJ  is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state  and  federal  courts  in  the  U.S.  alleging  similar  violations  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws  and  seeking  monetary  damages  and  other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.

## Epic Games

Epic Games, Inc. ('Epic') filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'California District Court') against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Store Review Guidelines violate California's unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the  Company's compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.

## Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course  of  business.  The  Company  settled  certain  matters  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2024  that  did  not  individually  or  in  the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations,  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  operating  results  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  materially  adversely affected.

## Gross Margin

Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):

|                               | 2024      | 2023      | 2022      |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

| Total gross margin percentage | 46.2 %    | 44.1 %    | 43.3 %    |

## Products Gross Margin

Products  gross  margin  and  Products  gross  margin  percentage  increased  during  2024  compared  to  2023  due  to  cost  savings, partially offset by a different Products mix and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

## Services Gross Margin

Services gross margin increased during 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to higher Services net sales.

Services gross margin percentage increased during 2024 compared to 2023 due to a different Services mix.

The Company's future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading 'Risk Factors.' As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.

## Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):

|                                     | 2024     | Change 2023   | Change   | 2022     |
|-------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Research and development            | $ 31,370 | 5 % $ 29,915  | 14 % $   | 26,251   |

| Total operating expenses            | $ 57,467 | 5 % $ 54,847  | 7 % $    | 51,345   |
| Percentage of total net sales       | 15 %     | 14 %          |          | 13 %     |

## Research and Development

The growth in R&D expense during 2024 compared to 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.

## Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expense increased $1.2 billion during 2024 compared to 2023.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):

|                                   | 2024     | 2023     | 2022     |
|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Provision for income taxes        | $ 29,749 | $ 16,741 | $ 19,300 |
| Effective tax rate                | 24.1 %   | 14.7 %   | 16.2 %   |
| Statutory federal income tax rate | 21 %     | 21 %     | 21 %     |

The Company's effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a one-time income tax  charge  of  $10.2  billion,  net,  related  to  the  State Aid  Decision  (refer  to  Note  7,  'Income  Taxes'  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and state income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.

The  Company's  effective  tax  rate  for  2024  was  higher  compared  to  2023  due  primarily  to  a  one-time  income  tax  charge  of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower tax benefits from sharebased compensation.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled $140.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

The Company's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:

## Debt

As of September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $97.3 billion (collectively the 'Notes'), with $10.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $38.5 billion, with $2.6 billion payable within 12 months.

The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.

## Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.6 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.

## Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.0 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months.

## Other Purchase Obligations

The Company's other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had other purchase obligations of $12.0 billion, with $4.1 billion payable within 12 months.

## Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable

As of September 28, 2024, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 'TCJA') was $16.5 billion, with $7.2 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.

## State Aid Decision Tax Payable

As of September 28, 2024, the Company had an obligation to pay €14.2 billion or $15.8 billion to Ireland in connection with the State Aid  Decision,  all  of  which  was  expected  to  be  paid  within  12  months. The  funds  necessary  to  settle  the  obligation  were  held  in escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.

## Capital Return Program

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the Company's quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board.

In May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

## Income Taxes

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the 'FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 202309, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Improvements  to  Income  Tax  Disclosures ('ASU  2023-09'),  which  will  require  the  Company  to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.

## Segment Reporting

In  November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ('ASU  2023-07'),  which  will  require  the  Company  to  disclose  segment  expenses  that  are  significant  and  regularly provided to the Company's chief operating decision maker ('CODM'). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial  statements  and  related  disclosures  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles ('GAAP')  and  the  Company's  discussion  and  analysis  of  its  financial  condition  and  operating  results  require  the  Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company's uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company's reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company's reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.

## Legal and Other Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.

## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

## Interest Rate Risk

The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company's investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company's term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.

The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company's investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated  derivatives,  that  would  result  from  a  hypothetical  increase  in  relevant  interest  rates  as  of  September  28,  2024  and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):

| Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument   | Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase   | Potential Impact                    | 2024    | 2023   |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|--------|
| Investment portfolio                 | 100 basis points, all tenors          | Decline in fair value               | $ 2,755 | 3,089  |
| Term debt                            | 100 basis points, all tenors          | Increase in annual interest expense | $ 139   | 194    |

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

The Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Changes  in  exchange  rates,  and  in  particular  a  strengthening  of  the  U.S.  dollar,  will  negatively  affect  the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company's assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.

The Company applied a value-at-risk ('VAR') model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669  million  as  of  September  28,  2024  and  September  30,  2023,  respectively.  Changes  in  the  Company's  underlying  foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company's foreign currency derivatives.

## Note 2 - Revenue

The  Company recognizes  revenue  at  the  amount  to  which  it  expects  to  be  entitled  when  control  of  the  products  or  services  is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  of  products  or  services  are  transferred  to  its  customers.  For  most  of  the  Company's Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company's Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.

The  Company  records  reductions  to  Products  net  sales  related  to  future  product  returns,  price  protection  and  other  customer incentive programs based on the Company's expectations and historical experience.

For  arrangements  with  multiple  performance  obligations,  which  represent  promises  within  an  arrangement  that  are  distinct,  the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices ('SSPs'). When available,  the  Company  uses  observable  prices  to  determine  SSPs.  When  observable  prices  are  not  available,  SSPs  are established that reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company's process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and  bundled  software  delivered  at  the  time  of  sale.  The  second  material  performance  obligation  is  the  right  to  receive  certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri  and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled  services,  the  allocation  of  revenue  is  based  on  the  Company's  estimated  SSPs.  Revenue  allocated  to  the  delivered hardware  and  bundled  software  is  recognized  when  control  has  transferred  to  the  customer,  which  generally  occurs  when  the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. ® ®

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled  consideration  relates  entirely  to  the  value  of  the  undelivered  services.  Accordingly,  the  Company  has  not  recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company  recognizes  revenue  based  on  the  gross  amount  billed  to  customers.  The  Company  considers  multiple  factors  when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company  accounts  for  all  third-party  application-related  sales  on  a  net  basis  by  recognizing  in  Services  net  sales  only  the commission it retains.

Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):

|                                 | 2024      | 2023      | 2022      |
|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| iPhone                          | $ 201,183 | $ 200,583 | $ 205,489 |
| Mac                             | 29,984    | 29,357    | 40,177    |
| iPad                            | 26,694    | 28,300    | 29,292    |
| Wearables, Home and Accessories | 37,005    | 39,845    | 41,241    |
| Services  (1)                   | 96,169    | 85,200    | 78,129    |
| Total net sales                 | $ 391,035 | $ 383,285 | $ 394,328 |

Total net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, $8.2 billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  2023  that  was  included  in  deferred  revenue  as  of  September  24,  2022,  and  $7.5  billion  of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.

The Company's proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, 'Segment Information and Geographic Data' for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.8 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.

## Note 3 - Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):

| Denominator:                              |            |            |            |
| Weighted-average basic shares outstanding | 15,343,783 | 15,744,231 | 16,215,963 |
| Effect of dilutive share-based awards     | 64,312     | 68,316     | 109,856    |
| Weighted-average diluted shares           | 15,408,095 | 15,812,547 | 16,325,819 |
| Basic earnings per share                  | $ 6.11     | $ 6.16     | $ 6.15     |
| Diluted earnings per share                | $ 6.08     | $ 6.13     | $ 6.11     |

Approximately 24 million restricted stock units ('RSUs') were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

As of September 28, 2024, 86% of the Company's non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 10% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years. As of September 28, 2024,  14%  of  the  Company's  non-current  mortgage-  and  asset-backed  securities  had  maturities  between  1  and  5  years,  9% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.

The  Company's  investments  in  marketable  debt  securities  have  been  classified  and  accounted  for  as  available-for-sale.  The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument's underlying maturity.

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and  may  designate  these  instruments  as  cash  flow  hedges.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its  forecasted  foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

## Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

The notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):

## Accounts Receivable

## Trade Receivables

The Company's third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 38% and 41% of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.

## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes  any  gain  on  these  sales  as  a  reduction  of  products  cost  of  sales  when  the  related  final  products  are  sold  by  the Company. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor nontrade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.

## Note 7 - Income Taxes

## European Commission State Aid Decision

On August  30,  2016,  the  Commission  announced  its  decision  that  Ireland  granted  state  aid  to  the  Company  by  providing  tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the 'State Aid Decision'). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion.

From time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.7 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The total balance of the escrow, including net unrealized investment gains, was €14.2  billion  or  $15.8  billion  as  of  September  28,  2024,  of  which  $2.6  billion  was  classified  as  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and $13.2  billion  was  classified  as  current  marketable  securities  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  Refer  to  the  Cash,  Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 4, 'Financial Instruments' for more information.

The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the 'General Court'). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice (the 'ECJ') and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. On September  10,  2024,  the  ECJ  announced  that  it  had  set  aside  the  2020  judgment  of  the  General  Court  and  confirmed  the Commission's 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, which represents $15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of the escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million.

## Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate

The provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022, consisted of the following (in millions):

As of September 28, 2024, the Company had $5.1 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $3.6 billion in California R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

As  of  September  28,  2024,  the  total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was  $22.0  billion,  of  which  $10.8  billion,  if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company's effective tax rate.

The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (in millions):

|                                                                  | 2024     | 2023     | 2022     |

| Beginning balances                                               | $ 19,454 | $ 16,758 | $ 15,477 |
| Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year     | 1,727    | 2,044    | 2,284    |

The  Company  is  subject  to  taxation  and  files  income  tax  returns  in  the  U.S.  federal  jurisdiction  and  many  state  and  foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between approximately $5 billion and $13 billion in the next 12 months, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing and deemed repatriation tax.

## Note 8 - Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.

Payments under the Company's lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases  of  output  of  the  underlying  leased  assets.  Lease  costs  associated  with  fixed  payments  on  the  Company's  operating leases were $2.0 billion for both 2024 and 2023 and $1.9 billion for 2022. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company's leases were $13.8 billion, $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company made fixed cash payments related to operating leases of $1.9 billion in both 2024 and 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022. Noncash activities involving right-of-use ('ROU') assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $1.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in millions):

Finance

The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company's lease liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 10.3 years and 10.6 years, respectively. The discount rate related to the Company's lease liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 3.1% and 3.0%, respectively. The discount rates related to the Company's lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company's incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company's leases cannot be readily determined.

As  of  September  28,  2024,  the  Company  had  $849  million  of  fixed  payment  obligations  under  additional  leases,  primarily  for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2026, with lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 21 years.

## Note 9 - Debt

## Commercial Paper

The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had $10.0 billion and $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, respectively,  with  maturities  generally  less  than  nine  months.  The  weighted-average  interest  rate  of  the  Company's  commercial paper  was  5.00%  and  5.28%  as  of  September  28,  2024  and  September  30,  2023,  respectively.

To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes, the Company uses interest rate swaps to effectively  convert  the  fixed  interest  rates  to  floating  interest  rates  on  a  portion  of  these  notes.  Additionally,  to  manage  foreign exchange rate risk on certain of its foreign currency-denominated notes, the Company uses cross-currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar-denominated notes.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.

The future principal payments for the Company's Notes as of September 28, 2024, are as follows (in millions):

| 2025                      | $ 10,930   |

## Note 11 - Share-Based Compensation

## 2022 Employee Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (the '2022 Plan') is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options  and  stock  appreciation  rights.  RSUs  granted  under  the  2022  Plan  generally  vest  over  four  years,  based  on  continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.

## 2014 Employee Stock Plan

The Apple  Inc.  2014  Employee  Stock  Plan,  as  amended  and  restated  (the  '2014  Plan'),  is  a  shareholder-approved  plan  that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $15.8 billion, $15.9 billion and $18.2 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees' obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 31 million, 37 million and 41 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company's closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees' tax obligations were $5.6 billion in both 2024 and 2023 and $6.4 billion in 2022.

| Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense | $ (3,350) | $ (3,421) | $ (4,002) |

As of  September 28, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $19.4 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.

## Note 12 - Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations

## Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The  Company  has  entered  into  certain  off-balance  sheet  commitments  that  require  the  future  purchase  of  goods  or  services ('unconditional  purchase  obligations').  The  Company's  unconditional  purchase  obligations  primarily  consist  of  supplier arrangements,  licensed  intellectual  property  and  content,  and  distribution  rights.  Future  payments  under  unconditional  purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2024, are as follows (in millions):

| 2025       | $ 3,206   |
|------------|-----------|
| 2026       | 2,440     |
| 2027       | 1,156     |
| 2028       | 3,121     |
| 2029       | 633       |
| Thereafter | 670       |
| Total      | $ 11,226  |

## Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable  possibility  the  Company  may  have  incurred  a  material  loss,  or  a  material  loss  greater  than  a  recorded  accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

## Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.

Substantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.

## Note 13 - Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region.

The  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company's chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.

The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. (the 'Company') as of September 28, 2024 and September  30,  2023,  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  comprehensive  income,  shareholders'  equity  and  cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP').

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States) ('PCAOB'),  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  September  28,  2024,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.  The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

Description of the Matter

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the  U.S.  and  numerous  foreign  jurisdictions. As  of  September  28,  2024,  the  total  amount  of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the  Company  uses  significant  judgment  in  the  interpretation  and  application  of  GAAP  and complex domestic and international tax laws.

Auditing management's evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management's  assessment  as  to  whether  tax  positions  are  more  likely  than  not  to  be sustained,  management's process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures.

We evaluated the Company's assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained  and  the  related  measurement  of  the  amount  of  tax  benefit  that  qualifies  for recognition. Our  audit  procedures  included,  among  others,  reading  and  evaluating management's assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company's communications with  taxing  authorities,  that  detailed  the  basis  and  technical  merits  of  the  uncertain  tax positions.  We  involved  our  tax  subject  matter  resources  in  assessing  the  technical  merits  of certain  of  the  Company's  tax  positions  based  on  our  knowledge  of  relevant  tax  laws  and experience  with  related  taxing  authorities.  For  a  certain  tax  position,  we  also  received  an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter with external advisors and the Company's tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the Company's disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements.

We have audited Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the 'COSO criteria'). In our opinion, Apple Inc. (the 'Company') maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States) ('PCAOB'),  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  the  Company  as  of  September  28,  2024  and  September  30,  2023,  the  related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  in  the  accompanying  Management's  Annual  Report  on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our  audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company's  assets  that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

## Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls

The  Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  The  Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

- (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;
- (ii) provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and
- (iii) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all  control  issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  those  internal  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  the  criteria  set  forth  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company's assessment, management has concluded that  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  September  28,  2024  to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  The  Company's  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,  Ernst  &  Young  LLP,  has  issued  an  audit  report  on  the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
