Since the first report pursuant to the Government\\nManagement Reform Act of 1994 was issued for fiscal year 1997, we have made great strides\\nin improving the usefulness of this important report.\\n\\nFor fiscal 2003, the U.S. Government is reporting a net operating cost of $665 billion, an\\n\\nincrease of $300 billion from the $365 billion net operating cost reported last year. The\\nincrease is primarily attributable to the increased cost of the global war on terrorism, increases\\nin the government’s post-retirement liabilities and a decline in tax revenues caused by the\\nsluggish economy. The report reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard this year\\nwhich requires the recording as an asset of military equipment and its related depreciation\\nresulting in an increase to assets of $383 billion.\\n\\nTwenty seven major departments and agencies received unqualified audit opinions on\\n\\ntheir FY 2003 financial statements and eight Departments issued their audited financial\\nstatements by mid-November, a significant increase from last year. When this accelerated\\nreporting time frame is accomplished by all agencies, it will set the stage for the timely\\npreparation of this report. I look forward to when we can issue the Financial Report in\\nDecember so that it is available to support the budget deliberation process.\\n\\nWhile much has been accomplished, much more remains to be done. Our efforts are well\\nunderway to eliminate the significant weaknesses cited by the auditors concerning the report’s\\ndata and processes. It will require a concerted effort across government to resolve these\\nmatters and, working with OMB and through the President’s Management Council and the\\nChief Financial Officer’s Council, Treasury believes we will succeed.\\n\\nThe government’s finances are important and complex, and our reporting will not be\\n\\ntruly effective until it provides reliable information in a timely and useful form. Treasury is\\ncommitted to meeting that challenge and to producing and reporting financial information that\\nmeets the highest standards expected by the American public.\\n\\n\\x0cThis page is intentionally blank.\\n\\n\\x0cDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\n3\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND\\nANALYSIS\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe quality and timeliness of financial reporting in the Federal Government has come a long way since the first\\n\\nGovernmentwide report subject to audit issued in March 1998 for fiscal year 1997. At that time, only 8 of the 24\\nChief Financial Officers Act (CFO Act) agencies received clean opinions on their 1997 financial statements. This\\nyear, 20 of the 24 agencies received clean opinions and 21 of the 32 entities, most significant to these statements,\\nhad audited financial statements issued by the end of the calendar year. This improvement in both quality and\\ntimeliness was concurrent with the application of new accounting principles and new accounting systems, and\\ninvolved performing reconciliations that had never been attempted before. This has been a monumental effort\\nrequiring years of planning and preparation and the efforts of thousands. However, we still have much to accomplish\\nbefore we meet our objective of timely, useful financial reporting.\\n\\nThe accompanying 2003 Financial Report of the United States Government is required by 31 U.S.C. §\\n331(e)(1) to be submitted to Congress by March 31, and consists of Management’s Discussion and Analysis\\n(MD&A), Statements of Net Cost, Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Position, Reconciliations of Net\\nOperating Cost and Unified Budget Deficit, Statements of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified Budget and Other\\nActivities, Balance Sheets, Stewardship Information (Unaudited), Notes to the Financial Statements, and\\nSupplemental Information (Unaudited). Each section is preceded by a description of its contents.\\n\\nExecutive Summary\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nThis Financial Report of the United States Government is prepared to give the President, Congress, and the\\nAmerican people information about the financial position of the Federal Government. This report provides, on an\\naccrual basis of accounting, a broad, comprehensive view of the Federal Government’s finances that is not available\\nelsewhere. It states the Government’s financial position and condition, its revenues and costs, assets and liabilities,\\nand other obligations and commitments. It also discusses important financial issues and significant conditions that\\nmay affect future operations.\\n\\nOperating Results\\n\\nRevenues were down by $81.7 billion primarily due to lower tax collections and costs were up by $225.8\\nbillion due to, among other things, fighting the global war on terrorism. This resulted in a net operating cost of\\n$665.0 billion. This compares with the net operating cost of $364.9 billion for fiscal year 2002. This MD&A\\ndiscusses results in a historical context and includes a chart (page 17) that shows the relationship of prior U.S.\\nbudget deficits as a percentage of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), which is the total value of goods and\\nservices produced in the United States.\\n\\nEconomic Results\\n\\nAfter recovering in fiscal year 2002 from the economic downturn, the economy continued to accelerate in\\nfiscal year 2003 and achieved strong growth. The rate of increase in real GDP picked up in each of the last three\\nquarters of the fiscal year and productivity continued to record substantial gains. The labor market stabilized in\\nfiscal year 2003 following job losses in the previous year and in the final quarter of the fiscal year, employment\\nbegan to increase. Improvement in the economy was aided by new fiscal policies in 2003, but the lingering effect of\\nthe recession and loss in equity wealth, the war with Iraq, homeland security spending, and lower taxes enacted to\\nstimulate growth contributed to a widening in the Federal budget deficit to $374.8 billion for the fiscal year.\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\nOverall Perspective\\n\\nThe 2003 balance sheet shows assets of $1,394 billion and liabilities of $8,499 billion, for a balance or\\n\\nnegative net position of $7,105 billion. The Government’s responsibilities to make future payments for social\\ninsurance and certain other programs are not shown as liabilities according to Federal accounting standards;\\nhowever, they are measured in other contexts. These programmatic commitments remain Federal responsibilities\\nand as currently structured will have a significant claim on budgetary resources in the future.\\n\\nAs summarized below, and in a more detailed table on page 12 of this section, the net present value for all of\\n\\nthe responsibilities (over a 75-year period) is $34,825 billion, including Medicare and Social Security payments,\\npensions and benefits for Federal employees and veterans, and other financial responsibilities. The reader needs to\\nunderstand these responsibilities to get a full understanding of the Government’s finances.\\n\\n Overall Perspective\\n(In billions of dollars)\\n\\nBalance\\nSheet\\n\\n2003\\nAdditional\\nResponsibilities\\n\\nCombined\\nAmounts\\n\\nBalance\\nSheet\\n\\n2002\\nAdditional\\nResponsibilities\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,394\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,394\\n\\n$\\n\\n997\\n\\n$\\n\\n1\\n\\n616\\n\\n--\\n(3,880)\\n(3,945)\\n(674)\\n(8,499)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(26,858)\\n--\\n--\\n(862)\\n(27,720)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(26,858)\\n(3,880)\\n(3,945)\\n(1,536)\\n(36,219)\\n\\n$\\n\\n--\\n(3,589)\\n(3,573)\\n(654)\\n(7,817)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(24,149)\\n--\\n--\\n(771)\\n(24,920)\\n\\n$\\n\\nCombined\\nAmounts\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,613\\n\\n(24,149)\\n(3,589)\\n(3,573)\\n(1,425)\\n(32,736)\\n\\n$\\n\\n($7,105)\\n\\n($27,720)\\n\\n($34,825)\\n\\n($6,820)\\n\\n($24,304)\\n\\n($31,123)\\n\\nASSETS\\nLIABILITIES & NET RESPONSIBILITIES\\n  Social Insurance\\n  Fed. empl. & veterans pensions/benefits\\n  Federal debt held by the public\\n  Other liabilities & responsibilities\\n     Total Liabilities & Net Responsibilities\\n\\nBALANCE   (Total Assets minus Total\\n        Liabilities & Net Responsibilities)\\n\\n1 Source: Fiscal Year 2004 Analytical Perspectives, page 37,\\nDefense Fixed Reproducible Capital, Nonfinancial Assets.\\n\\nNote:  Overall details may not add to total due to rounding.\\n\\nThe table does not reflect the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 that\\nwas enacted on December 8, 2003. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actuaries estimated that\\nthis legislation would result in direct spending outlays totaling $534 billion over the 2004-2013 period. The 75-year\\nperiod net present value estimate is not yet available.\\n\\nSignificant Reporting Items for Fiscal Year 2003\\n\\nDepartment of Defense Property Addition\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2003, the Department of Defense’s (DOD) reported general property, plant, and equipment, net\\n\\nincreased by $323.7 billion or 264.2 percent over fiscal year 2002. The majority of this increase was due to the\\ninitial recording of the value of DOD’s military equipment.\\n\\nBeginning with the fiscal year 2003 financial statements, DOD was required to record on the balance sheet the\\n\\nvalue of its military equipment under the new Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard No. 23,\\nEliminating the Category National Defense Property, Plant, and Equipment (SFFAS No. 23) issued by the Federal\\nAccounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) in May 2003. SFFAS No. 23 establishes generally accepted\\naccounting principles for valuing and reporting military equipment in Federal financial statements. Previously,\\nmilitary equipment was reported as national defense property, plant, and equipment in the Stewardship Information\\nsection of this report. For a detailed discussion of this increase, see the Assets section of the Asset and Liability\\nSummary of this report.\\n\\nCreation of the Department of Homeland Security\\n\\nOn March 1, 2003, more than 20 entities and offices and some 180,000 employees were transferred into the\\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS). The creation of the DHS in 2003 was the most significant transformation\\nof the Federal Government since 1947 when the various branches of the U.S. Armed Forces were merged into a new\\nDepartment of Defense.\\n\\n\\x0cDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\n5\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the President and the Congress recognized the\\n\\nneed to coordinate the efforts of many Federal agencies, offices, and programs which had responsibility for various\\naspects of protecting and securing our homeland. President Bush proposed the creation of DHS, and Congress\\npassed legislation establishing this new department. See the U.S. Government Structure & Performance section of\\nthis report for further details and a chart showing the entities transferred into DHS.\\n\\nIraq Operations\\n\\nIn March 2003, an international coalition led by the United States liberated Iraq and is overseeing a\\n\\ntransformation. The vision for a sovereign, stable, prosperous, and democratic Iraq centered on four goals:\\nestablishing a secure environment, restoring essential services, promoting economic growth, and developing good\\ngovernance through a legitimate constitutional government. To conduct military operations and address these goals\\nin 2003, several sources of funding were used: appropriated and nonappropriated funds (seized and vested assets and\\nthe Development Fund for Iraq). U.S. agencies obligated $3.9 billion in appropriated funds for Iraq relief, renewal,\\nand construction. Congress also appropriated funds to DOD for Operation Iraqi Freedom in the Emergency Wartime\\nSupplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11) the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003\\n(Public Law 108-7). DOD obligated $42.4 billion for incremental costs in support of Iraqi Freedom. For further\\ndiscussion of the cost of Iraq operations and funding sources and uses, see Iraq Operations in the Financial Results\\nsection at the end of the Revenue and Cost Summary.\\n\\nDebt Ceiling\\n\\nOn February 20, 2003, Treasury’s outstanding debt reached the statutory limit of $6,400 billion. This requires\\nTreasury to change its normal borrowing operations to stay within the limit. When this occurs, numerous statutory\\ntools are used which allow the Government to manage without issuing new debt and to continue operations for short\\ntime periods. On May 27, 2003, President Bush signed legislation increasing the statutory debt limit to $7,384\\nbillion (P.L. 108-24). For further discussion of the debt ceiling, see the Federal Budget and Federal Debt section of\\nthe MD&A.\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\nFinancial Results\\n\\nRevenue and Cost Summary\\n\\nStatement of Operations and Changes in Net Position Comparison\\n(In trillions of dollars)\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n(0.5)\\n\\n(1.0)\\n\\nActuarial\\nCosts\\n\\nNon-Actuarial\\nCosts\\n\\nTotal Revenue\\n\\nNet Cost of U.S.\\nGovernment\\nOperations\\n\\nNet Operating Revenue\\n(Cost)\\n\\n99\\n\\n00\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n03\\n\\n99\\n\\n00\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n03\\n\\n99\\n\\n00\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n03\\n\\nAccrual-Based Results\\n\\nThe financial statements (pages 58-62) present information about the financial position of the Federal\\n\\nGovernment, the net costs of its operations, and the financing sources used to fund its operations. The information in\\nthese statements gives a comprehensive view of the Government’s finances. The information is reported generally\\non the accrual basis of accounting in which costs are recorded when a liability is incurred. This differs from the\\nprimarily cash basis used in calculating the budget results, in which outlays are recorded when bills are actually\\npaid. See Note 1B (Basis of Accounting and Revenue Recognition) of this Financial Report for a discussion of how\\nrevenues are recorded.\\n\\nThe net operating cost as shown in these financial statements for fiscal year 2003 was $665.0 billion, compared\\n\\nto a budget deficit of $374.8 billion. The primary component of the difference between the budget and accrual\\nreported results is the recognition of the year’s actuarial expense for pension and health liabilities for civilian and\\nmilitary employees and veteran’s compensation of $290.6 billion. This difference is similar to fiscal year 2002\\nwhich had a net operating cost of $364.9 billion and a budget deficit of $157.7 billion. For a detailed reconciliation\\nbetween the two numbers, see the Reconciliations of Net Operating Cost and Unified Budget Deficit in the Financial\\nStatements section.\\n\\n\\x0cDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\n7\\n\\nBecause the Government traditionally has been viewed from a budget perspective, and because many of the\\n\\nterms used to describe financial events have different meanings when describing budget outcomes, a conscious\\neffort has been made to refer to budget-based amounts by using the term “budget” in order to eliminate any possible\\nconfusion. Net operating revenue (cost) is the term used to represent accrual-based operating results and equates to\\nrevenue less net cost of Government operations.\\n\\nIndividual Income Tax\\n (In billions of dollars)\\n\\nCorporation Income Tax\\n (In billions of dollars)\\n\\n2000\\n\\n1500\\n\\n1000\\n\\n500\\n\\n0\\n\\n300\\n\\n250\\n\\n200\\n\\n150\\n\\n100\\n\\n50\\n\\n0\\n\\n1999\\n\\n2000\\n\\n2001\\n\\n2002\\n\\n2003\\n\\n1999\\n\\n2000\\n\\n2001\\n\\n2002\\n\\n2003\\n\\nThe Government’s main source of revenue comes from its ability to demand payments from the public (e.g.,\\ntaxes, duties, fines, and penalties). As shown in the chart above, the Government’s principal source of revenue is\\nindividual income tax. In 2003, this revenue category was $1,481.3 billion, representing 82.5 percent of total\\nrevenue. This compares to $1,538.6 billion in 2002, a decrease of $57.3 billion or 3.7 percent from 2002. Since\\nfiscal year 2000, when they were 10.0 percent of total revenue, corporate income taxes have fallen until they are 7.1\\npercent of total revenue in fiscal year 2003.\\n\\nIn 2003, total revenue was $1,796.0 billion. This amount compares to $1,877.7 billion in 2002, a decrease of\\n\\n$81.7 billion or a decline of 4.4 percent. Revenue has declined primarily due to a drop in individual income tax and\\ntax withholdings and can be attributed to a variety of factors, including an economy recovering slowly from a\\nrecession, recently enacted tax cuts, and a decline in capital gains realizations.\\n\\nIn addition to revenue from its ability to tax, the Government’s other source of revenue comes from providing\\ngoods and services to the public for a price. This type of revenue is called “earned” revenue because it results from\\nthe exchange of transactions. Examples of earned revenue include the postage and mailing fees paid to the U.S.\\nPostal Service and Medicare Part B premiums collected by HHS (these premiums do not comprise the majority of\\nMedicare Part B’s funding). This revenue is used to pay for or offset the costs of administering these programs or\\nservices and is included in the calculation of net cost on the Statements of Net Cost. In fiscal year 2003, the\\nGovernment earned $164.8 billion from this type of revenue. This amount compares to $156.6 billion in fiscal year\\n2002, an increase of $8.2 billion or 5.2 percent.\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\nNet Cost Comparison\\n(In billions of dollars)\\n\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n\\n800\\n\\n700\\n\\n600\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\nDept. of\\nDefense\\n\\nSocial\\nSecurity\\nAdmin.\\n\\nDept. of\\nHealth &\\nHuman\\nSvcs.\\n\\nInterest on\\nDebt Held\\nby the\\nPublic\\n\\nDept. of\\nVeteran\\nAffairs\\n\\nAll Other\\nEntities\\n\\nThe above chart compares significant elements of net cost by fiscal year. The largest charge was DOD’s fiscal\\n\\nyear 2003 cost increase of $143.4 billion, or 35.3 percent. This increase was primarily incurred due to fighting the\\nglobal war on terrorism and an increase in DOD’s military post retirement costs. DOD’s military post retirement\\ncosts increased mainly due to an increase in its actuarial liabilities. DOD’s cost in 2003 was also affected by the\\nadoption of SFFAS No. 23 which required, for the first time, capitalizing military equipment and recording\\ndepreciation expense. The significant decrease in DOD cost from fiscal year 2001 to 2002 is the result of the initial\\nnon-recurring effect of the extension of $293.0 billion in medical benefits to retired personnel and another $91.3\\nbillion in other actuarial assumption changes in 2001.\\n\\nThe social insurance costs at the Social Security Administration (SSA) and HHS continued their consistent\\nupward trend during fiscal year 2003. From fiscal year 2002 to 2003, the net costs of SSA and HHS increased by 4.0\\npercent and 8.5 percent, respectively. The interest on debt held by the public continued to decrease during fiscal year\\n2003. Even while the debt principal increased again, the interest on the debt decreased by $18.6 billion, or 10.6\\npercent, due to the lower interest rates that continued to prevail in fiscal year 2003. The fiscal year 2003 $42.2\\nbillion, or 19.6 percent, decrease in costs for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) shows the significant impact\\nof changes in the actuarial calculation of the liability for future years’ veterans’ compensation and burial benefits on\\nthe Department’s total cost (see further discussion in the Liabilities section of the MD&A).\\n\\n\\x0cDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\n9\\n\\nNet Cost\\n(In trillions of dollars)\\n\\nNet Operating Revenue (Cost)\\n(In billions of dollars)\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n-\\n\\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\\n\\nAs Reported\\n\\nExcluding the\\nchange in actuarial\\nliabilities\\n\\n250.0\\n\\n-\\n\\n(250.0)\\n\\n(500.0)\\n\\n(750.0)\\n\\nAs Reported\\n\\nExcluding the\\nchange in actuarial\\nliabilities\\n\\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\\n\\nThe charts above show that over the past 5 fiscal years, significant costs associated with certain employee\\nbenefit liabilities have had a major impact on the Government’s cost of operations. These incremental costs are the\\nresult of changes in interest rates and other actuarial assumptions. Also shown is that, absent these adjustments, all\\nother costs are steadily trending upward and the net operating revenue (cost) has fluctuated from break-even in fiscal\\nyear 1999 to a net operating cost of $468.4 billion in fiscal year 2003. Actuarial liabilities include Federal employee\\nand veteran benefits payable and are discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to the Financial Statements section.\\n\\nIraq Operations\\n\\nIraq Relief & Reconstruction\\n\\nIn March 2003, an international coalition led by the United States liberated Iraq and is overseeing a\\n\\ntransformation. The vision for a sovereign, stable, prosperous, and democratic Iraq centered on four goals:\\nestablishing a secure environment, restoring essential services, promoting economic growth, and developing good\\ngovernance through a legitimate constitutional government. Total funds of $9.5 billion were available in 2003 for\\nIraq relief and reconstruction efforts overseen by the Coalition Provisional Authority. This includes both\\nappropriated and nonappropriated funds (seized and vested assets and the Development Fund for Iraq). Of this\\namount, approximately $7.6 billion was allocated or committed.\\n\\nAppropriated Resources—In 2003, $4.5 billion in congressionally appropriated resources were used for Iraq\\nrelief, renewal, and reconstruction. Of this amount, about $3.9 billion was obligated in fiscal year 2003; this includes\\n$1.1 billion in funds obligated by DOD for oil infrastructure and Coalition Provisional Authority administrative\\nexpenses.\\n\\nOperation Iraqi Freedom\\n\\nIn the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11) the Consolidated\\nAppropriations Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 108-7), Congress appropriated funds to DOD for Operation Iraqi\\nFreedom. DOD obligated $42 billion for incremental costs in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom: $10 billion was\\nspent for personnel pay and personnel support costs; and $6 billion was spent to transport personnel, equipment, and\\nmaterials. The remaining $26 billion was spent for military operations, including the incremental costs for feeding\\nand housing the troops, fuel for combat vehicles, logistics support, other military necessities, and Coalition\\nProvisional Authority operating expenses.\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\nAsset and Liability Summary\\n\\nAssets\\n\\nThe assets of the U.S. Government are the tangible resources available to pay liabilities or to satisfy future\\nservice needs.

This increase mainly was due to a change in the way that DOD reports its military equipment.\\n\\nIn May 2003, the FASAB issued SFFAS No. 23 which became effective for accounting periods beginning after\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2002. SFFAS No. 23 establishes generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for valuing and\\nreporting military equipment in Federal financial statements. That is, it requires the capitalization and depreciation\\nof the cost of military equipment, including the cost of modifications and upgrades. Previously, military equipment\\nwas expensed when acquired and reported as national defense property, plant, and equipment in the Stewardship\\nInformation section of this report.\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2003, the DOD equipment component increased by $324.6 billion. Most of this increase was due\\nto the inclusion of $325.1 billion in military equipment on DOD’s balance sheet. The $325.1 billion net book value\\nis the result of an estimated total acquisition cost of military equipment of $1,123.5 billion with accumulated\\ndepreciation of $798.4 billion. This change also resulted in a change in accounting principle ($383.1 billion)\\nreported on the Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Position and Note 17 of this report.\\n\\nDOD has determined that it is not yet possible to accumulate the information necessary to value its military\\n\\nequipment for financial statement presentation using its own financial systems. Instead, DOD based the value of its\\nmilitary equipment on data provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce. DOD is\\nworking to revise its accounting processes and systems to provide this information in the future. (See DOD’s\\nindividual financial statements for further details).\\n\\n\\x0cDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\n11\\n\\nLiabilities\\n\\nThis chart presents a 5-year comparison of the major components of liabilities reported on the balance sheets as\\n\\nof September 30, for fiscal years 1999 through 2003. At the end of fiscal year 2003, the U.S. Government reported\\nliabilities of $8,498.6 billion, as compared to $7,816.7 billion for September 30, 2002, an 8.7 percent increase.\\n\\nLiabilities - Key Items Comparison\\n(In billions of dollars)\\n\\n4,000\\n\\n3,500\\n\\n3,000\\n\\n2,500\\n\\n2,000\\n\\n1,500\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n500\\n\\n0\\n\\nFederal Employee and\\nVeteran Benefits\\nPayable\\n\\nFederal Debt\\nSecurities Held by the\\nPublic and Accrued\\n\\nEnvironmental and\\nDisposal Liabilities\\n\\nAll Other Liabilities\\n\\n1999\\n\\n2000\\n\\n2001\\n\\n2002\\n\\n2003\\n\\n 2,600.7\\n\\n 2,764.7\\n\\n 3,360.8\\n\\n 3,589.4\\n\\n 3,880.0\\n\\n 3,674.2\\n\\n 3,454.2\\n\\n 3,359.3\\n\\n 3,573.2\\n\\n 3,944.9\\n\\n 313.2\\n\\n 301.2\\n\\n 306.8\\n\\n 273.0\\n\\n 249.9\\n\\n 321.1\\n\\n 336.8\\n\\n 358.0\\n\\n 381.1\\n\\n 423.8\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2003, Federal debt securities held by the public and accrued interest increased 10.4 percent so it\\nis, once again, the largest liability on the balance sheet at $3,944.9 billon. This is a $371.7 billion increase over the\\nbalance at the end of fiscal year 2002. Both fiscal years’ 2003 and 2002 increase in debt held by the public primarily\\nis due to total Federal spending exceeding total Federal revenues.\\n\\nThe next largest liability, $3,880.0 billion, is Federal employee and veteran benefits payable (which was the\\nlargest for fiscal year 2002), which consists of pension, disability, and retiree health care costs for Federal civilian\\nand military employees, as well as for veterans. This liability also increased in fiscal year 2003 by $290.6 billion or\\n8.1 percent. The largest component of this liability is for civilian and military pensions which, with a combined\\nbalance of $1,929.4 billion, increased 3.7 percent in fiscal year 2003. The next largest piece of this liability, $954.8\\nbillion for veterans’ compensation and burial benefits, increased $105.6 billion or 12.4 percent, due to a large\\nincrease in the average size and number of veteran compensation beneficiaries resulting from Agent Orange cases\\nand an increase in the assumed average benefit payment. The civilian and military retiree health benefits component,\\n$927.4 billion, has more than doubled since fiscal year 2000. The military retiree health component has increased\\nthreefold since fiscal year 2000, primarily due to a law passed in 2001 that extended new health benefits to military\\nretirees effective in 2002. See Note 11 in the Notes to the Financial Statements section for a more detailed\\nexplanation of this liability.\\n\\nAnother liability is related to environmental cleanup costs associated with environmental damage and\\n\\ncontamination. As of September 30, 2003, the recognized cost of cleaning up environmental damage and\\ncontamination across Government programs was estimated to be $249.9 billion, a decrease of $23.1 billion or 8.5\\npercent from September 30, 2002. The most significant component of this reduction relates to the Department of\\nEnergy (Energy). Energy has reduced its environmental liability by $26.3 billion or 12.5 percent in fiscal year 2003;\\nthis is the second year in a row that Energy’s environmental liability decreased. The decrease in 2003 primarily was\\ndue to restructuring the cleanup program to focus on its core mission and accelerating cleanup.\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\nAdditional Responsibilities\\n\\nHistorically, the Government’s financial situation has been evaluated primarily from a cash-based budgeting\\n\\nperspective that measures the flow of funds in and out of Government accounts. As a first step in examining our\\nfinancial position, we are presenting a condensed perspective based on forward-looking accrual principles. This\\nperspective is meant to complement the cash-based budget estimates of future spending and receipts.\\n\\nIn addition to accrual-based results, the overall perspective depicted below includes many responsibilities\\ndisclosed throughout this report but not captured by accrual-based operating results or liability balances. An attempt\\nis made here to go beyond the balance sheet to also examine the impact of these other responsibilities.\\n\\nOverall Perspective\\n\\nThe schedule below reveals a more complete picture of the Government’s financial responsibilities—its\\n\\nliabilities and responsibilities on the balance sheet as well as its responsibilities that are tracked off the balance\\nsheet.\\n\\nOverall Perspective\\n (In billions of dollars)\\n\\nBalance\\nSheet\\n\\n2003\\nAdditional\\nResponsibilities\\n\\nCombined\\nAmounts\\n\\nBalance\\nSheet\\n\\n2002\\nAdditional\\nResponsibilities\\n\\nCombined\\nAmounts\\n\\nASSETS\\n  Inventory, cash\\n  Property, plant & equipment\\n  Loans receivable\\n  Other\\n      Total Assets\\n\\nLIABILITIES & NET RESPONSIBILITIES\\n  Social Insurance\\n    Medicare (Parts A & B)\\n    Social Security (OASDI)\\n    Other (Railroad Retirement)\\n       Subtotal, Social Insurance\\n  Fed. empl. & veterans pensions/benefits\\n  Federal debt held by the public\\n  Other liabilities\\n  Other responsibilities\\n     Total Liabilities & Net Responsibilities\\n\\nBALANCE   (Total Assets minusTotal\\n        Liabilities & Net Responsibilities)\\n\\n1 Source: Fiscal Year 2004 Analytical Perspectives,\\npage 37, Defense Fixed Reproducible Capital,\\nNonfinancial Assets.\\nNote:  Overall details may not add to total due to\\nrounding.\\n\\n$\\n\\n361\\n658\\n221\\n154\\n1,394\\n\\n-\\n$\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n$\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n361\\n658\\n221\\n154\\n1,394\\n\\n334\\n325\\n219\\n119\\n997\\n\\n1\\n\\n-\\n$\\n616\\n-\\n-\\n$\\n616\\n\\n$\\n\\n334\\n941\\n219\\n119\\n1,613\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n(3,880)\\n(3,945)\\n(674)\\n-\\n(8,499)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(15,006)\\n(11,742)\\n(110)\\n(26,858)\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n(862)\\n(27,720)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(15,006)\\n(11,742)\\n(110)\\n(26,858)\\n(3,880)\\n(3,945)\\n(674)\\n(862)\\n(36,219)\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n(3,589)\\n(3,573)\\n(654)\\n-\\n(7,817)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(12,896)\\n(11,215)\\n(38)\\n(24,149)\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n(771)\\n(24,920)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(12,896)\\n(11,215)\\n(38)\\n(24,149)\\n(3,589)\\n(3,573)\\n(654)\\n(771)\\n(32,736)\\n\\n$\\n\\n($7,105)\\n\\n($27,720)\\n\\n($34,825)\\n\\n($6,820)\\n\\n($24,304)\\n\\n($31,124)\\n\\nSocial Insurance Calculations\\n\\nThe social insurance present value amounts are based on 75-year actuarial projections of scheduled benefits\\n\\nand legislated taxes for current participants.\\n\\nThe present value of these future responsibilities (at January 1, 2003), as presented in the pertinent agencies’\\n\\nfinancial statements, is $15,006 billion for Medicare and $11,742 billion for Social Security. These numbers are\\nfrom the Statements of Social Insurance on page 64 of this Financial Report. The total of these future\\nresponsibilities, including Other and Railroad Retirement social insurance responsibilities of $862 billion and $110\\nbillion, respectively, is $27,720 billion. These items are not recorded on the balance sheet because current\\naccounting standards (GAAP) do not permit it. FASAB is reviewing this area and if it determines that it is proper to\\nrecord these items, we will do so. A more detailed discussion of these projections and the future outlook for Social\\nSecurity and Medicare is found in the Stewardship Information section.\\n\\n\\x0cDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\n13\\n\\nAs can be seen, the impact of these responsibilities is significant. Clearly, the social insurance component\\nrepresents a major fiscal responsibility and serious future challenge for the Federal Government. Medicare and\\nSocial Security increased by $2,110 billion (or 16.4 percent) and $527 billion (or 4.7 percent), respectively, over\\nfiscal year 2002. Moreover, the 2003 combined total of the future responsibilities (i.e., $27,720 billion) is more than\\nthree times the 2003 total accounting liabilities and responsibilities on the balance sheet (i.e., $7,105 billion).\\n\\nFederal Budget and Federal Debt\\n\\nAt this time, the largest liability for the Federal Government is the Federal debt held by the public and accrued\\ninterest, which was $3,945 billion in 2003. This was an increase of $372 billion over the 2002 debt of $3,573 billion.\\nThere are two kinds of Federal debt: debt held by the public and the debt the Government owes to itself.\\n\\nDebt Held by the Public\\n\\nThe first kind of Federal debt is debt held by (or owed to) the public. It includes all Treasury securities (bills,\\nnotes, bonds, and other securities) held by individuals, corporations, Federal Reserve banks, foreign governments\\nand other entities outside the U.S. Government. This debt is included as a liability on the balance sheet.\\n\\nDebt the Government Owes to Itself\\n\\nThe second kind is debt the Government owes to itself (intra-governmental debt), primarily in the form of\\nspecial nonmarketable securities held by various parts of the Government. The laws establishing Government trust\\nfunds generally require the excess receipts of the trust funds to be invested in these special securities. This debt is\\nnot included on the balance sheet since these payments are claims of one part of the Government against another and\\nare eliminated for consolidation purposes.\\n\\nStatutory Debt Ceiling (Limit)\\n\\nBoth kinds of debt are included in the total debt subject to the limit set by the Congress. The Congress has\\ntraditionally exercised control on the size of the Government’s debt by establishing limits on the amount of Treasury\\nsecurities that can be outstanding. This limit is known as the debt ceiling.\\n\\nOn February 20, 2003, Treasury’s outstanding debt reached the statutory limit of $6,400 billion. When this\\noccurs, various statutes authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to “suspend the issuance of additional amounts of\\nobligations of the United States, if such issuances could not be made without causing the public debt of the United\\nStates to exceed the public limit, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.” On May 27, 2003, President Bush\\nsigned legislation increasing the statutory debt limit to $7,384 billion (P.L. 108-24).\\n\\nThe following chart shows the amounts of debt held by the public and intra-governmental debt from 1999\\n\\nthrough 2003.\\n\\n'"
