Nihilism
												(Spring/Summer 1994) is the third collection by the British designer Alexander
													McQueen for his fashion house. An
												eclectic collection with no straightforward theme, it pushed back
												against dominant womenswear trends with its hard tailoring and
												aggressive, sexualised styling. It was created in collaboration with
												McQueen's associates Simon Ungless and Fleet Bigwood. McQueen's first
												professional runway show, Nihilism included experimental
												techniques, silhouettes and materials, such as dresses made from cellophane, stained
												with clay or adorned with dead locusts. The styling was intended to be
												provocative and disturbing. The clothing was highly sexualised: thin
												fabric that exposed the skin underneath or garments cut to expose
												breasts and vulvas. The collection received mixed reviews. Journalists
												had a difficult time deciding what to make of it. McQueen returned to
												many of the ideas he explored in Nihilism throughout his
												lifetime, especially the interplay of sexuality and violence. (Full article...)
